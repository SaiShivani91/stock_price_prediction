# Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Forecasting

The main objective of the project to develop an algorithm for stock price prediction using Time series forecasting. The Microsoft stock price data from 2018 to 2022 is used in this project. Various statistical, machine learning and deep learning models like ARIMA, SARIMAX, Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM are employed in this. The best model is selected on the basis of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 

The techniques implemented in the project are:

- Data Collection
- Data Transformation
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Model selection

The tools used in the project are:

- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- stats models
- scikit learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras

After the comparison of all models, XGBoost model has given the best results. IT is selected for further analysis.
